## Fruit Multiclass Detection

**Details:** this model will be built using traditional machine learning, with an effort to identify whether there exists a certain fruit in a given image (object detection). This project will be written using a tensor library called CuPy, which is a library that mirrors the NumPy API but with GPU acceleration. Expect to write backpropagation, gradient descent, MLPs, and CNNs from scratch.

**Team size:** 3

**Progression:**
- learning how autograd works 
- implementing an autograd library 
- writing a simple MLP
- creating a simple Linear layer
- creating Sequential, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, etc. 

**Technologies:** CuPy/NumPy, Python
